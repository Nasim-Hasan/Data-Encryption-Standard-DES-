Assignment 2

Program executes DES-CBC cryptography.
Makefile included, to compile simply enter "make"
to run a test, command:

"make run_e" to create an encrypt txt file of test.txt, and 
"make run_d" to decrypt the out.txt file back into the original message.

To test your own text files or to cross check with OpenSSL, the command syntax is:

./DES <OPEARTION> <INPUT FILE NAME> <OUTPUT FILE NAME> [<HEX KEY>] [<HEX IV>]

where OPERATION can be: 
'-enc' for encryption, with quotes, and 
'-dec' for decryption, again without quotes

The hex key and IV are optional, if not inputed, they will be generated for you
and outputed into a file called "Key_IV.txt". Key must come before the IV.

Decryption requires both a key and an IV.
