Assignment 3

Program encryption.c decrypts an encrypted session key and prints the 
result in plaintext as "decrypted.key".
It then uses the key and generates a "random" IV for DES encryption
stored in "IV.txt".
It takes in a plainttext and uses the session key and random IV to
encrypt and create a cyphertext.
It takes the ciphertext and signs it using the signers private PEM key
into "signature.sha2"

Program decrypt.c takes a decrypts the cyphertext and decripts it.
It takes a signature and verifies its authenticy.




Makefile included, to compile simply enter "make"
to run a test command:

"make run_e" to run encryption.c with preset arguments. 
"make run_d" to run decrypt.c with preset arguments.
"make clean" will remove all object files and anything named:
encrypt
decrypt
IV.txt
cyphertext.txt
decrypted.key
decryptedtext.txt
signature.sha2

To test your own text files, the command syntax is:

./encryption <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE> <OWN PRIVATE KEY> <THIRD PARTY PUBLIC KEY> <ENCRYPTED SESSION KEY>

or

./decrypt <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE> <THIRD PARTY PUBLIC KEY> <PLAINTEXT SESSION KEY FILE> <IV FILE> <SIGNATURE>


simply entering ./encryption or ./decrypt to receive a reminder of syntax
